  "description": "This IoT-based project focuses on real-time fall detection and location monitoring for elderly care. The system utilizes various sensors to detect motion and falls within specific areas of a home, such as bedrooms and living rooms. When a fall is detected, the system triggers an automatic notification via SMS to a designated caretaker using the Twilio API. The system's backend is integrated with Firebase, which stores and updates the current location of the individual in real-time. A web-based floor plan dynamically highlights the active room based on location changes, providing caretakers with real-time visibility of the individualâ€™s whereabouts. The system aims to enhance safety and improve response times in emergency situations.",
